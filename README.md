Converts lines from an image into parametric equations using Fourier transforms, lines are generated by traversing image with DFS and searching for white pixels. White pixels are created at edges, currently using a modified Sobel filter. A line is defined by contiguous pixels that cannot backtrack, starts from top-left.

Usage: pretty rudimentary at the moment, just change "img" input in main.rs to desired image and run it like a normal rust program. generated equations will appear in images/equations.txt. see generated islands in images/lines.png.

TODO:
- better DFS so more islands become contiguous, there are some issues with pathing so I can't just DFS omnidirectionally towards unexplored nodes from the beginning
- support actual images by converting to lines based on contrast
